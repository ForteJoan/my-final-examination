Important of Github and Git..
GitHub is a centralized platform. Centralized for developers all around the globe. A person can just host the repository created in Git to the whole world.  Using this, it increases the chances of better project development and in less time. GitHub provides us with the easiness of combining the changes and removes the headache of sharing the large code files. If GitHub is not there, we will face a series of challenges in order to work together as a team.First of all, the code needs to be shared among our teammates. A code file on a big project is heavy and will take a lot of resources. After the upload, when our teammates will make the changes to the file, they still have to upload the complete file each and every time. This problem is not present when we use GitHub. Just make the changes and push only the changes to the main code file. It will be fast and easy. As a project owner, you can track these changes quite easily on it
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes we make to files, so we have a record of what has been done, and we can revert to specific versions should ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. So regardless of whether we  write code that only us  will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for us. Git is software that runs locally. Our files and their history are stored on our computer. We can also use online hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) to store a copy of the files and their revision history. Having a centrally located place where we can upload our changes and download changes from others, enable us l to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the changes, so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without loosing each otherâ€™s work!
